# Welcome to Band Protocol

Band Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts.

This documentation is split into two sections:

- [**Whitepaper**](./whitepaper): Contains our official whitepaper, covering BandChain's system overview, token economics, protocol messages, and much more.
- [**Developer Docs**](./developer): The go-to place for developers looking to learn more about Band and to integrate Band's oracle into their applications.

## Band Protocol At a Glance

Blockchains are great at immutable storage and deterministic, verifiable computations. However, they cannot access trusted real-world information available outside their networks. Band Protocol enhances smart contract functionalities by granting them access to reliable data without any central points of failure.

Band's flexible oracle design allows developers to use any data including real-world events, sports, weather, random numbers and more. Developers can create custom-made oracles using WebAssembly to connect smart contracts with traditional web APIs within minutes.

Our blockchain, BandChain, is designed to be compatible with most smart contract and blockchain development frameworks. It does the heavy lifting jobs of pulling data from external sources, aggregating them, and packaging them into the format that’s easy to use and verified efficiently across multiple blockchains.

For more information on BandChain, please see our [whitepaper](./whitepaper).
