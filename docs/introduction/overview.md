# High-Level Overview

Band Protocol is a **cross-chain data oracle platform** that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts.

Band's flexible oracle design allows developers to **query any data** including real-world events, sports, weather, random numbers and more. Developers can create custom-made oracles using WebAssembly to connect smart contracts with traditional web APIs within minutes.

Our blockchain, BandChain, is designed to be **compatible with most smart contract and blockchain development frameworks**. It does the heavy lifting jobs of pulling data from external sources, aggregating them, and packaging them into the format thatâ€™s easy to use and verified efficiently across multiple blockchains.
